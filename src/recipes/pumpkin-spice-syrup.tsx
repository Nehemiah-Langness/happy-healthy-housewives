                Y'allâ€¦ Fall has officially arrived and all the stores have put out their sugary pumpkin spice treats. If you're anything
                like me, you love all things pumpkin and pumpkin spice! When I began Trim Healthy Mama a few years back, I knew I needed to
                recreate my favorites in a more blood sugar friendly way. No more missing out on holiday treats! This Pumpkin Spice Syrup is
                sure to jazz up your morning or afternoon cup of joe! Coffee shops? Who needs them!

                your own to measure out this whole season, or you can buy some from the super-market!
