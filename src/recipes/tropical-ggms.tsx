                Good Girl Moonshine is probably my favorite sipper from the <b>Trim Healthy Mama</b> cookbooks. You can make it different
                every day, itâ€™s great for your skin, and aids in digestion. This variation was created out of a need for an extra boost in
                hydration! Coconut water is extremely hydrating, and the tropical theme of this variation followed. Sip on this{' '}
