            <p>Preheat oven to 350&deg; F.</p>

        <>
            <p>I enjoy my pizza in my <AcronymToggle>DF</AcronymToggle> lifestyle forgoing the cheese and adding lots of delicious meats and veggies on top. Personally, I also like to mix a little bit of Olive Oil and chopped garlic and spread that on top after my pizza is finished baking. </p>
