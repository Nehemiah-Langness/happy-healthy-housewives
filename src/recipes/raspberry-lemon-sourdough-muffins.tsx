                This Recipe was missing, so I pieced it together from the website files, but Mandy and Brianna need to put in a nice quote
                here. Until then, enjoy this nice quote from me.

export default recipe;

// Ingredients:
// • 2 cups ACTIVE sourdough starter
// • 3 Tbsp egg whites
// • 1 tsp vanilla extract
// • 1 tsp lemon extract
// • ¼ tsp mineral salt
// • ¼ cup unsweetened applesauce
// • ½ cup THM Gentle Sweet (or ½ tsp pure stevia)
// • 1 tsp aluminum free baking soda
// • ¼ cup fresh or frozen raspberries (I like to do a mix of black and red)
// • 1 tsp coconut oil
// • Sprinkle of THM Gentle Sweet (to top the muffins)

// Instructions:
// Preheat oven to 400℉. Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray.
// Add sourdough starter, egg whites, extracts, salt and sweetener to mixing bowl and
// beat on low until combined. Add in applesauce, mixing on low until combined.
// Add baking soda and mix on low until batter begins to bubble up and grow in size.
// Gently fold in the raspberries.
// Pour the mixture into the muffin tin, filling each cup about ¾ of the way.
// Bake for 15 minutes, or until a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean.
// Remove from oven, brush melted coconut oil and a sprinkle of THM Gentle Sweet
// on top of the muffins. Place back into the oven for 2 minutes, or until the tops are
// crisp.
// Remove from oven and allow to cool for 2 minutes, then remove muffins from tin
// and allow them to fully cool on a rack.
